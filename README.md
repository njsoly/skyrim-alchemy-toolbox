# skyrim-alchemy-toolbox
I started this as a fork to give credit to https://github.com/zsiciarz/skyrim-alchemy-toolbox, because I wanted the ingredients JSON in it.

I've been writing Kotlin code, and have diverted widely from the original.  I'm moving this code to https://github.com/njsoly/skyrim-alchemy now, and will continue with that standalone project, but bringing zsiciarz's ingredients.json with me.
